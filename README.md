# PythonCodes
In this Repository, you will find .py files that either run Neo4j query or demonstrate the alogrithm.

movies.py contains code to demonstrate cosine similarity. In this, we have used 'cast', 'genres', 'director', and 'keywords' fields to find similalrity among movies. 

Database connection using python.py contains code to connect Neo4j with Python and test the connection with the help of a simple query that retrieves a genre.

Movie Recommend.py contains code to recommend movies to the user based on its cosine similarity with other users. The query finds the movies that the user has not watched yet and recommends similar movies.
